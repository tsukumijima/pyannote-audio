## Version 4.0.0 (2025-09-29) 

### TL;DR

#### Improved speaker assignment and counting

`pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1` pretrained pipeline relies on VBx clustering instead of agglomerative hierarchical clustering (as suggested by [BUT Speech@FIT](https://speech.fit.vut.cz/) researchers [Petr Pálka](https://github.com/Selesnyan) and [Jiangyu Han](https://github.com/jyhan03)).

#### *Exclusive* speaker diarization

`pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1` pretrained pipeline returns a new *exclusive* speaker diarization, on top of the regular speaker diarization.
This is a feature which is [backported from our latest commercial model](https://www.pyannote.ai/blog/precision-2) that simplifies the reconciliation between fine-grained speaker diarization timestamps and (sometimes not so precise) transcription timestamps.

```python
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained(
    "pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1", token="huggingface-access-token")
output = pipeline("/path/to/conversation.wav")
print(output.speaker_diarization)            # regular speaker diarization
print(output.exclusive_speaker_diarization)  # exclusive speaker diarization
```

#### Faster training

Metadata caching and optimized dataloaders make training on large scale datasets much faster.  
This led to a 15x speed up on [pyannoteAI](https://www.pyannote.ai) internal large scale training.

#### [pyannoteAI](https://www.pyannote.ai) premium speaker diarization

Change one line of code to use [pyannoteAI](https://docs.pyannote.ai) premium models and enjoy **more accurate speaker diarization**.

```diff
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained(
-    "pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1", token="huggingface-access-token")
+    "pyannote/speaker-diarization-precision-2, token="pyannoteAI-api-key")
diarization = pipeline("/path/to/conversation.wav")
```

#### Offline (air-gapped) use

Pipelines can now be stored alongside their internal models in the same repository, streamlining fully offline use.

1. Accept `pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1` pipeline [user agreement](https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1)
2. Clone the pipeline repository from Huggingface (if prompted for a password, use a Huggingface access token with correct permissions)

    ```bash
    $ git lfs install
    $ git clone https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1 /path/to/directory/pyannote-speaker-diarization-community-1
    ```

3. Enjoy!

    ```python
    # load pipeline from disk (works without internet connection)
    from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
    pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained('/path/to/directory/pyannote-speaker-diarization-community-1')

    # run the pipeline locally on your computer
    diarization = pipeline("audio.wav")
    ```

#### Telemetry

With the optional telemetry feature in `pyannote.audio`, you can choose to send anonymous usage metrics to help the `pyannote` team improve the library.
